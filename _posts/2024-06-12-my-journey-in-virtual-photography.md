for me, everything started years ago. while exploring various video games, even multiplayer ones, i often took screenshots on Steam of cool scenery. sometimes, i didn’t even mind if the hud was visible; i just wanted to capture the beautiful compositions i came across. over time, i discovered games with dedicated photo modes and began exploring all the options they offered. i was impressed by the capabilities of these features, especially when they included elements similar to real photography cameras and lenses.

at some point, i stumbled upon a [steam group dedicated to beautiful screenshots](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/art_in_games), and i was instantly captivated by the creativity and skill of other people’s work. it motivated me to dive deeper, and i started finding people from there on twitter and joining communities like FRAMED. when i first visited the [Hall of FRAMED](https://framedsc.com/HallOfFramed/), i was blown away by what was possible. every picture felt like a piece of art. from there, i followed more creators and explored the main site, where i discovered numerous guides and third-party tools that revolutionized how people capture stunning in-game shots.

at first, i was a bit discouraged by the paywalls for some tools. but as i followed more people on twitter, i learned about a FRAMED discord server. the idea intrigued me, but for a while, i hesitated to join because i felt my screenshots were too basic compared to the incredible work i saw online. eventually, though, i became motivated to improve. i reached out to one of the founders and asked about joining the server. i was eager to learn the techniques behind the shots i admired and improve my own skills. joining the community turned out to be the biggest step in this hobby for me. i met amazing people who shared tips and tools, but we also had casual, fun conversations beyond virtual photography.

being part of this community inspired me to purchase my first "pro" tools from [Otis_Inf's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/c/Otis_Inf/home). these tools were revolutionary - they allowed unprecedented control over the game, enabling me to capture stunning and highly detailed shots. this was when i began creating the shots that i now upload here on my blog.

nowadays, i take things slower, as i balance this hobby with other interests. however, whenever i find a fascinating game, i set aside time to capture its beauty. one aspect for me is that i separate my first playthrough of a game from the process of taking shots. using tools and capturing detailed images often requires changing the game’s settings, which aren’t always ideal for regular gameplay. so, i usually wait until i’ve finished a game before diving into virtual photography.

i’d love for more people to discover this hobby. even if they don’t participate directly, just following it can be incredibly inspiring. below, i’ve included some resources and recommendations i’ve gathered over time:

### getting started
if you’re interested in starting this hobby, i highly recommend visiting the [FRAMED community website](https://framedsc.com/). it’s packed with guides for specific games and universal tips that apply to almost any game. the explanations there are far more detailed than i could provide, and the site is an invaluable resource. the community is also open to everyone - you can find more information on their [Join Us page](https://framedsc.com/joinus.htm).

### tools
the best tools, in my opinion, are those provided by [Otis_Inf on his patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/c/Otis_Inf/home). these include both game-specific tools and universal ones for games built on engines like Unreal Engine. the subscription costs only $6 per month, and you only need to renew it if you want access to new releases or updates required for game patches. once downloaded, the tools are yours to keep forever.
