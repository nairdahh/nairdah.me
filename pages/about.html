  <!-- defautl about me -->
  <div id="about-me">
    <span id="hi-im-adrian">hi, i'm adrian,</span><br />
    a creative soul exploring the intersection of art and technology. this site
    is my personal corner of the internet, a place that has evolved alongside my
    own interests. it's where i document my journey, blending visual
    storytelling with the logic of code to create things that matter to me.
    <br /><br />
    video games have always been my window into other realities, shaping how i
    perceive the world. for me, they are fully immersive experiences that
    deserve to be soaked in. this passion naturally evolved into virtual
    photography, allowing me to capture cinematic moments and tell my own
    stories from inside the games i love.
    <br /><br />
    my eye for virtual shots actually stems from a long-standing passion for
    cinematography and traditional photography. i've always loved framing the
    world through a lens, and bringing that discipline into gaming was a natural
    step. whether digital or real, i'm always chasing that perfect composition
    and lighting.
    <br /><br />
    lately, i've been channeling my creativity into building small apps and
    projects. using code and the help of llms, i love bringing ideas to life in
    my own way. there is something incredibly satisfying about turning a concept
    into a working tool, and seeing people find them useful or simply enjoy
    using them makes it all worth it.
    <br /><br />
    on a personal note, life outside the screen can be challenging. living with
    tourette's and adhd, while dealing with some depression and anxiety, makes
    some days heavier than others. working on these projects and photos has been
    my anchor - it helps me focus, quiets the noise, and gives me a constructive
    way to navigate through it all.

  <!-- about VP -->
  <div id="about-vp" style="display: none">
    for me, everything started years ago. while exploring various video games,
    even multiplayer ones, i often took screenshots on Steam of cool scenery.
    sometimes, i didn’t even mind if the hud was visible; i just wanted to
    capture the beautiful compositions i came across. over time, i discovered
    games with dedicated photo modes and began exploring all the options they
    offered. i was impressed by the capabilities of these features, especially
    when they included elements similar to real photography cameras and lenses.
    <br /><br />
    at some point, i stumbled upon a
    <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/art_in_games"
      >steam group dedicated to beautiful screenshots</a
    >, and i was instantly captivated by the creativity and skill of other
    people’s work. it motivated me to dive deeper, and i started finding people
    from there on twitter and joining communities like FRAMED. when i first
    visited the <a href="https://framedsc.com/HallOfFramed/">Hall of FRAMED</a>,
    i was blown away by what was possible. every picture felt like a piece of
    art. from there, i followed more creators and explored the main site, where
    i discovered numerous guides and third-party tools that revolutionized how
    people capture stunning in-game shots. <br /><br />
    <p align="center">
      <a
        href="https://framedsc.com/HallOfFramed/"
        class="img-href vpbuttonclass2"
        ><img
          src="/assets/hof.png"
          alt="Hall of FRAMED"
          class="nav-image-button center aboutvpimg"
      /></a>
    </p>
    at first, i was a bit discouraged by the paywalls for some tools. but as i
    followed more people on twitter, i learned about a FRAMED discord server.
    the idea intrigued me, but for a while, i hesitated to join because i felt
    my screenshots were too basic compared to the incredible work i saw online.
    eventually, though, i became motivated to improve. i reached out to one of
    the founders and asked about joining the server. i was eager to learn the
    techniques behind the shots i admired and improve my own skills. joining the
    community turned out to be the biggest step in this hobby for me. i met
    amazing people who shared tips and tools, but we also had casual, fun
    conversations beyond virtual photography.
    <br /><br />
    being part of this community inspired me to purchase my first "pro" tools
    from
    <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/Otis_Inf/home">Otis_Inf's Patreon</a>.
    these tools were revolutionary - they allowed unprecedented control over the
    game, enabling me to capture stunning and highly detailed shots. this was
    when i began creating the shots that i now upload here on my blog.
    <br /><br />
    nowadays, i take things slower, as i balance this hobby with other
    interests. however, whenever i find a fascinating game, i set aside time to
    capture its beauty. one aspect for me is that i separate my first
    playthrough of a game from the process of taking shots. using tools and
    capturing detailed images often requires changing the game’s settings, which
    aren’t always ideal for regular gameplay. so, i usually wait until i’ve
    finished a game before diving into virtual photography.
    <br /><br />
    i’d love for more people to discover this hobby. even if they don’t
    participate directly, just following it can be incredibly inspiring. below,
    i’ve included some resources and recommendations i’ve gathered over time:
    <br /><br />
    <b>getting started</b><br />
    if you’re interested in starting this hobby, i highly recommend visiting the
    <a href="https://framedsc.com/">FRAMED community website</a>. it’s packed
    with guides for specific games and universal tips that apply to almost any
    game. the explanations there are far more detailed than i could provide, and
    the site is an invaluable resource. the community is also open to everyone -
    you can find more information on their
    <a href="https://framedsc.com/joinus.htm">Join Us page</a>. <br /><br />

          alt="FRAMED"
          class="nav-image-button center aboutvpimg"
      /></a>
    </p>
    <b>tools</b><br />
    the best tools, in my opinion, are those provided by
    <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/Otis_Inf/home"
      >Otis_Inf on his patreon page</a
    >. these include both game-specific tools and universal ones for games built
    on engines like Unreal Engine. the subscription costs only $6 per month, and
    you only need to renew it if you want access to new releases or updates
    required for game patches. once downloaded, the tools are yours to keep
    forever. <br /><br />

            i've always been fascinated by the art of filmmaking and have spent
            a lot of time studying and exploring cinematography, understanding
            how visuals and storytelling come together to create something
            unforgettable.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            this has given me a deeper appreciation when watching movies and has
            also helped me develop a better way of discovering new films to

            music is more than just something i enjoy - it's an experience.
            sometimes it feels like stepping into another world, crafted by my
            favorite songs, where melodies and lyrics come together and hit me
            in such a unique way. it's not just about listening, it's about
            feeling, like the music knows me, and i know it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            there's something powerful about the way a song can resonate so
            deeply, transporting me, calming me, or stirring emotions i didn't
            know were there. sometimes it even helps me with my tourette's (the
            more you know), quieting everything else for a little while. music
            isn't just sound to me, it's a really important part of who i am,
            and i know it might sound exaggerated or "generic," but that's truly
            how i feel about it.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            besides that, it's a really good way to connect with someone else.
            knowing i have people and friends with whom i can share my songs and
            discovering they also really resonate with and enjoy them is like
            food for my soul. it helps me bond with people in a way that feels
            special.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            over the past years, i've come across many songs that i've fallen in
            love with. for my most recent ones, i started creating some Spotify
            playlists that I love to share with anyone. i mostly enjoy listening
            to and discovering songs from any era or genre (with a few
            exceptions, of course, that i don't resonate with), but my main
            genres are Metal and Electronic.
          </p>

              >Let Me Rust</a
