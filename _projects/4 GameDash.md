### Features:
 - **Random Game Fun:** Every time you hit the button, GameDash sends you to a random browser game. Perfect for when you’re bored and indecisive!
 - **Game History:** Keep track of your adventures with a handy list of the last 15 games you’ve played. Want to revisit a game? No problem - click the link in the list and jump back into action.
 - **No Repeats:** Don’t worry about seeing the same game twice! As long as a game is in your list of recent games, it won’t come up again until it’s rotated out.
 - **Curated Game List:** All games are handpicked from a collection of browser-based titles sourced from itch.io.
 - **Genre Selection:** Looking for something specific? GameDash offers a wide variety of genres to choose from, including action, puzzle, strategy, visual-novel, and even educational games.
